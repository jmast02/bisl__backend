## Bisl
Bisl is an app for exploring the recipes created by Andrew Rea, aka Oliver Babish, through his Youtube channel, Binging with Babish

## Motivation
Often when cooking, it is difficult to look up recipes on the web or YouTube. This project was created to help fans of Binging with Babish have quick and native access to all of the Binging recipes right on their phone while cooking.

Furthermore, social features for saving and sharing recipes with friends would be nice to have.

Thus Bisl was born.

Oh, and the name Bisl comes from the Yiddish word that mean, "a little bit of something, a tiny piece"
