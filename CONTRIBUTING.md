# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following are a set of guidelines for contributing to Bisl.

## Getting Started

Bisl is build on Django and uses docker and docker-compose to run the project in _every_ environment it is run, as well as for tests.

If you are familiar with these tools you shouldn't have any problem running, testing, and contributing to the project.

Please read all of the [docs in the project](https://github.com/jmichelsen/bisl__backend/tree/master/docs) before contributing. 

## Issues
If you encounter a bug or would like to suggest enhancements, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/jmichelsen/bisl__backend/issues)

Provide as much detail as you are able when opening new issues.

The product road map can be found in the [project board](https://github.com/jmichelsen/bisl__backend/projects/1)

## Pull Requests
Pull Requests are always welcome. 

 1. Pull requests must have a passing build (passing tests, and linter) to be approved
 2. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. It should include:
    -  A summary of the changes being proposed
    -  An estimated priority (low/medium/high)
    -  An appropriate tag (bugfix, enhancement)
    -  A description of smoke testing procedure one could follow
    -  A reference Issue that is being addressed. If one doesn't exist, add one first
